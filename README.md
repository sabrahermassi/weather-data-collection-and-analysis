## Overview

This project collects weather data using Python, Flask and PostgreSQL. It periodically fetches real-time data from a Weather API, stores it in PostgreSQL, and returns the weather data for a specific city.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and set up on your development environment:
- Python: Version 3.12.4 or higher.
- PostgreSQL: Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running locally. You can download it from PostgreSQL Downloads.
- `(https://www.postgresql.org/download/)` is the URL to the PostgreSQL Downloads page.
